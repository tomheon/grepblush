= grepblush

A simple python script through which you can pipe things like log
files and get colorized lines based on regular expression matching.

= Usage

Assuming grepblush.py is available in your path, you'll probably want
to do something like:

cmd_producing_log | grepblush.py matchfile

= Matchfile syntax

The matchfile syntax is:

regex=color

Where regex is a python regular expression (which has to match the
line using *match*, not find).  The regular expression may contain the
char '=', as the parser looks for the last = in the line when parsing.

The color designation should either be a bash color code (e.g. 0;30
for black), or one of the special built in codes: red, yellow, green,
blue, purple, or light_gray.

Regexs are attempted in the order they appear in the matchfile, and
the first match is used to determine the color.  This means you can
use a default at the bottom of the file, for example:

=light_gray

To make any non-matching lines even easier to ignore.

See matchfile.sample for a sample file suitable for log4j and
imitators.
